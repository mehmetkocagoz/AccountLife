# AccountLife
Personal Accounting Application
I designed a Project named as Account Life as a Desktop application. I designed the project for myself. The goal of project is storing my daily spending and creating a monthly expense table with daily expense information. Project has a database of food prices. User is selecting foods from the database and application calculates a daily spending for food expense. Other outlays are entered into the program manually.
